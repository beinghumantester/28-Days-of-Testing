# Day 12 of #28DaysOfTesting

One question. Takes three minutes.

Walk over to a developer. Or message them. Whatever works. Ask:

"What are you most worried about in the feature you are building right now?"

A lot of us never ask this. I did not for years. It felt like overstepping. Like I was supposed to figure everything out on my own.

Then I started asking. And the answers changed how I tested.

"I am not sure the error handling works when the API times out."  
"The migration script has not been tested with real data volumes."  
"Honestly? I wrote that part at 2 am and barely remember what I did."

Every single answer pointed me somewhere I would not have looked. Developers know where the weak spots are. They just do not always speak about them unless you ask.

## What they responded to me

In one of my projects, I was on leave and the developers were assigned to test and deploy the build.

After I returned, I asked them about their experience with testing and what worried them most while validating the release.

Their answer was simple: they were worried about bugs slipping into production.

I still remember that discussion. It was interesting to see how different testing felt to them when they were responsible for catching what might break in real scenarios. It was no longer about writing code. It was about thinking in terms of risk, impact, and user behavior.

That made something clear. Everyone can test, but not everyone naturally thinks like a tester.

Testing is not just executing flows. It is questioning assumptions, exploring uncertainty, and looking where others might not.

And sometimes, all it takes is asking the right question to uncover where the real weak spots are.
