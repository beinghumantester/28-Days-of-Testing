## Day 8 of #28DaysOfTesting

Weekend question  
What’s your testing soundtrack?

Music  
Podcasts  
Complete silence  
Or the distant sound of builds failing 👀

For me, it’s either classical music or electronic.  
It depends on the work.

If I need deep focus, classical helps me think clearly.  
If I need energy, electronic keeps me moving.

What keeps you in the zone?


## What keeps me in the zone?


For me, lofi and soft music are usually the first choice.  
They help me stay calm and focused, especially during long testing sessions.  
But honestly, it depends a lot on the mood and the situation.  
When I’m working alone, I often switch to Hindi songs.  
They feel familiar and make the work feel a little lighter.
